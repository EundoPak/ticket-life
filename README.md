Let's configure our first ticket as a user! Click "Open a New Ticket" and input one of your user's accounts. For the Help Topic select Report a Problem and we will create a scenario. The scenario is a user submitting a high priority request of their online banking portal being down, some people can access the site but cannot log in.

To view the ticket and make changes, log on to your Help Desk 1 Agent's account and select "Open Tickets". Click on the created ticket and observe the properties of the ticket.
