Let's configure our first ticket as a user! Click "Open a New Ticket" and input one of your user's accounts. For the Help Topic select Report a Problem and we will create a scenario. The scenario is a user submitting a high priority request of their online banking portal being down, some people can access the site but cannot log in.

To view the ticket and make changes, log on to your Help Desk 1 Agent's account and select "Open Tickets". Click on the created ticket and observe the properties of the ticket. On observation, we can infer that this ticket has a wide and severe business impact because the accessbility is compromised.

As Help Desk 1 set the SLA as Sev-A. Update the Help Topic to Report a Problem/Business Critical Outage for a better description of the issue. Update the Priority level to Emergency, and finally assign the ticket to our department Online Banking. The ticket has now been elevated and as Help Desk 1, you will no longer be able to make any changes to the ticket. Log out of Help Desk 1's account and log into the SystemAdmin's account to resolve the ticket!

Next, assign the ticket to the SystemAdmin's account and confirm. From here we will talk to our client through this account and get more info.
